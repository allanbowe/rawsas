The SAS London Users Group (SLUG) is a London-based user led community dedicated to realising the value of SAS software.  Sounds great.  But what does this actually mean?

<h4>London Based</h4>
Whilst our meetups take place in London, users are welcomed from across the UK and the rest of the world.  SLUG vs SUKUG - easy winner!  The venue may change - for latest details, check out our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/preview/SAS-London-Users-Group">website</a>.
<h4>User Led</h4>
Being User Led means exactly that - the opinions and feedback of our members will drive the content we produce, and the direction of the group.  Every meetup is a chance to network and hear presentations from Users on real-world SAS topics.  It's also an opportunity for you to share your knowledge and experience.  New presenters welcomed!
<h4>Community</h4>
The world of SAS has many strong online communities (SAS-L, Stackoverflow, SAS Communities), which is perhaps apt for software users.  Still, there are many people (myself included) that value the 'old fashioned' approach to building a community.  Namely, actually meeting up!  Hence the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/preview/SAS-London-Users-Group">meetup group</a>.
<h4>Realising the Value of SAS Software</h4>
The success of a SAS platform depends primarily on the knowledge and experience of Users - be they Administrators, Developers, Analysts or Data Managers.  SAS is incredibly flexible, and a support network can be a lifeline for 'how best to achieve this' type questions.

Your involvement in the SAS London User Group will enable you to:

<ul>
 	<li>Foster connections and collaborate with other SAS professionals.</li>
 	<li>Increase your understanding of SAS products and services.</li>
 	<li>Stay up to date on new offerings and the latest techniques.</li>
</ul>

So - whether you are local to London or here on a business trip, be sure to stop by and attend one of our regular meetups!  You'll learn something new, meet someone new, and maybe even drink somewhere new.
