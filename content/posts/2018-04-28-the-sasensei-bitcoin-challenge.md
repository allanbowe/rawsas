To celebrate the recent launch of the Sasensei final level (Custom Quiz Builder) we're running a promotion in April, May and June this year. The prize - \$100 in Bitcoin - is given to the player who submits the best question of the month. Note that "best" is not related to difficulty - but rather it means that it has been voted up (by the community) and is interesting, well written, fun, and/or educational!

Think you have what it takes? You need to be Green Belt (100 rep and above) in order to unlock 'submit' capability.

See you in the dojo!  <a href="https://sasensei.com">https://sasensei.com</a>
