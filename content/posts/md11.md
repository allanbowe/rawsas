If you've ever done any moderate googling on a SAS topic you've probably unearthed a thread on SAS-L, quite possibly from several decades ago.  You'd be forgiven for assuming that this simply something that "used to exist' because - up until recently - that's exactly what I thought too.

Well - how wrong I was.  SAS-L is still alive and kicking.  The "L" stands for listserv, and is a mail server run by the University of Georgia.  It's basically a spamming service for SAS issues (am sure there is a better word for it though).

Getting started is as easy as 1,2,3:

1 - Sign up to the listserv service: <a href="https://listserv.uga.edu/cgi-bin/wa?GETPW1">https://listserv.uga.edu/cgi-bin/wa?GETPW1</a>
2 - Verify your email
3 - Subscribe to SAS-L  mailing list: <a href="https://listserv.uga.edu/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=sas-l">https://listserv.uga.edu/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=sas-l</a>

There is a ton of information on SAS-L on <a href="http://www.sascommunity.org/wiki/SAS-L" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sasCommunity</a>, and even a dedicated sugi <a href="http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi28/247-28.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper</a>.  So get involved - and you could be the next Rookie of the Year!
