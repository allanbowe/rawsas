Phew - 4.5 hours later, the problem is solved!&nbsp; Let me save you 4 hours and 25 minutes, if you are submitting / getting the response below when trying to connect to your GIT repository from within a company firewall (on Windows):<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">$ ssh -T git@bitbucket.org</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ssh: connect to host bitbucket.org port 22: Bad file number</span><br /><br />The problem I had related to proxy authentication.&nbsp; I was able to make this work by updating the config file in the ~/.ssh folder.&nbsp; This is normally located in C:users[username].ssh.&nbsp; If the file does not exist, create it - and add the information below:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ProxyCommand connect.exe -H [ProxyUser]@[ProxyServer]:[ProxyPort] %h %p<br />Host bitbucket.org<br />&nbsp;IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa</span><br /><br />Note the space before IdentityFile (apparently this is important).&nbsp; The %h and %p values are replaced with target hostname and port when ProxyCommand is invoked by your ssh command. &nbsp; But you do need to provide your system values for the [ProxyXXX] settings. &nbsp; So how do you get the proxy server details (when the browser is set to auto-detect proxy settings)?&nbsp; Well, the [ProxyUser] is most likely your login name (it was for me). &nbsp; The rest can be worked out from<a href="http://superuser.com/questions/346372/how-do-i-know-what-proxy-server-im-using"> this thread</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is the command I used to pull my repository (note the lack of a slash before OWNER):<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">git clone git@bitbucket.org:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git</span><br /><br />Happy coding!
