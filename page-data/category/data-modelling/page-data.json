It is useful in the following scenarios:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Optimising for speed of joins</li>\n<li>Enabling business keys with null values</li>\n<li>Handling composite keys with a large number of columns</li>\n<li>Integrating with systems which require a short, numeric identifier</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A Retained Key will “retain” its value even if the record (non PK column) is changed. It can be likened to a hash key - which is a checksum, with separator, of the key values.  If the source record is deleted, the retained key may also be deleted, or it can be “closed out” with a delete flag or an SCD 2 high date.</p>\n<p>Hash keys have the advantage that they can be generated without joining back to the base table - so, faster load times. The disadvantage of hash keys is that they take more space - 32 bytes minimum, typically, vs 8 bytes for a numeric.</p>\n<p>A Retained Key differs from a Surrogate Key in that a surrogate key is not linked to the business key of the table - somewhat like a UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier).</p>\n<p>SAS ETL Developers will be familiar with the capabilities of DI Studio for managing retained keys</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/sasjs/core\">SASjs/core</a> library has a macro to assist SAS Programmers and Application Developers with the same. Features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Table Lock Management (mp_lockanytable)</li>\n<li>Metadata Storage (max retained key)</li>\n<li>Uniqueness check (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The documentation for the macro is here: <a href=\"https://core.sasjs.io/mp__retainedkey_8sas.html\">https://core.sasjs.io/mp__retainedkey_8sas.html</a></p>\n<p>This is the same macro used for updating tables with Retained Keys in <a href=\"https://datacontroller.io\">Data Controller for SAS®</a>.
